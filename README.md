In this Project, I will use my newly found knowledge of HTML to make a very basic Website with a small amount of Webpages.

Since HTML is only the basic foundation to developing a Website, it won't have any visual appeal yet.
Though in short, this Web-Project will showcase the following skills:
- Setting up the basic boilerplate of a HTML
- Giving a basic HTML a heading and putting content on the page
- Linking differen Webpages together


Later such Websites with their Webpages will have not only the basic HTML construct, but the CSS behind it to make it visually more appealing.
