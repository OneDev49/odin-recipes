                    Cover the saucepan and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes (the longer the better as long as the sauce is not sticky).

                    Add the flour into the butter, stir vigorously for 2 minutes. Gradually add the milk, stirring until the sauce thickens.
                    Stir in the cheese, reserving as muhc as you will want to sprinkle on top of the lasagna.
                    Stir the cheese into the flour and butter mixture until it has melted completely. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper.
